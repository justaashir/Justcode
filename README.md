## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Beginners usually start by learning HTML, then CSS, then JS and then NPM, GIT  and then other things.... their motivation starts to end as they proceed because there are no milestones other than getting a job after being a web developer..

 They just want to complete the development journey as fast as possible and get the job, but they do get into the tutorial rut + things like imposter syndrome. No guidance leads to it.
So What should we do?

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
The Idea, is to divide the learning process into so many milestones, that person will achieve and enjoy, and get updates. For example he learns HTML, and directly upload the plain HTML website to Netlify. It's a motivation that you've made your first webpage, now you just have to style it, after styling and learning CSS and Flexbox/Grid and making some designs. You're now a "Web Designer". Now let's have a look at next approach "Web Development". In this way person will get motivated at every step, I'll also help them to end up with a freelance-ready portfolio and I'll also review their portfolio myself

## ⛓️ Roadmap <a name = "roadmap"></a>
![](https://justcode.netlify.app/Roadmap-min.png)

- This is a rough roadmap, but in my case that's what I do all the time. I learned lots of things, but I use these listed things usually.
- Skip most of the part, learn different hacks, learn modern things and done....
- Learn how to debug, Learn how to Figma, Learn how to Animate
- APIs are great...
- Your development environment should be productive
